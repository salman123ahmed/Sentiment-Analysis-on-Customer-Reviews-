# Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews 


### Project Description:

Develop a text classifier for a kind of text of your choice (e.g., e-mail messages, tweets,
customer reviews) and at least two classes (e.g., spam/ham, positive/negative/neutral)*.

* For e-mail spam filtering, you may want to use the Ling-Spam or Enron-Spam datasets (available
from http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software.html). For tweets, you may want to use datasets from
http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/. For customer reviews, you may want to use datasets from
http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task5/. Could you consult the instructor for further details?
* Pre-trained word embeddings are available, for example, from http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.
